# GPX und KML coordinate files for canyons from Descente-Canyon.com
Unofficial GPX und KML coordinate files based on the data from https://www.descente-canyon.com/ 

Use with care. Descente doesn't provide such files or make it easy to access the coordinates, and they will have their reasons for this. For me these files make planing more efficient, faster and safer. But 
please don't expect the coordinates to be right and rely on them.

The data is from 2019.

[descente-canyon-summaries.kml](./descente-canyon-summaries.kml) (the points from the summary map)  
[descente-canyon-positions.kml](./descente-canyon-positions.kml) (points from the canyon detail maps, entries, exists, parking, etc.)  
[descente-canyon-positions.gpx](./descente-canyon-positions.gpx) (like the kml file, for apps that don't support kml)  

# App support
They files should work with almost every app, but not every app handles the large number of points well. They do work 
excellent with Locus Map on Android and probably OruxMaps (and a lot more). 

On Apple devices there is no app that comes even close to Locus or Orux. In my opinion Cartograph Pro is the 
only decent alternative to both Android apps, but is harder to set up and use. Maps.me seems to work ok and is probably easier to use.

# TODO 
* convince the descente creators that coordinate files are good thing, and that they should offer them on their site
* better icons
* canyon summary in the description of the summary coordinates
* fixes for different apps (?)
* you tell me
